    <h1>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!</h1>
    <p>
      Well, 2020 sure was... something. There are so many things we missed this
      year, but most of all we missed seeing you. We love and miss you all and
      look forward to 2021 with hope that things will be better.

      In April we closed on our new house and we've loved turning it into our
      home! We doubled our square footage and have lots more space for the kids
      to play. And no, we would not recommend moving during a pandemic.

        Mike started working from home full-time in March, and the family is
        never letting him go back. He's been able to enjoy three meals a day
        with the kids, and loves all the extra minutes he gets to see of their
        constantly-changing lives. Becky loves that he's around for the really
        bad diaper changes.

        Becky didn't find the COVID lockdowns restrictive enough, and spent the
        entirety of her pregnancy on intermittent bedrest, IV fluids, and lots
        of medicine. She survived on bites of food and lots of sno cones, and
        really long Netflix binges (we're still not sure how Mike survived
        during any of that).

        Rose began her kindergarten year (fully homeschooled) and is loving
        reading and social studies. She loves being the oldest, she gets more
        independent (and opinionated) every day, and is absolutely obsessed with
        the Disney show Lion Guard (if you have a few spare hours, she'll tell
        you all about it).

        Kolbe turned 3, found some sass, and still has the sweetest smiles after
        the biggest of tantrums. He's loving preschool (also homeschooled),
        loves anything as long as it's the color red, and plans to spend 2021
        learning to ride a bike.

        Leo switched from baby to toddler overnight and we're not sure why that
        had to happen. He is the sweetest, happiest kid you'll ever meet and
        gets away with all sorts of trouble because of his cute face. He became
        a big brother for the first time this year and loves "his" baby so very
        much.

        Chiara entered the world in August of this year. She came a full month
        early, and after causing lots of stress while in utero, continued the
        trend after birth. She spent her first 15 days in the NICU and is an
        absolute miracle of a baby. We've lost a lot of sleep over her, but
        she's been worth every worry.
